- This is the final version of Movie App for Web App Dev:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wJ7hZjHOYI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wJ7hZjHOYI)

## Setup Requirements

I used `npm` to manage packages in this project, and uploaded the `package.json` file. Enter `npm install` to install all the dependencies demanded.

After installing all packages, use `npm start` to run this project. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

Scripts listed here:

- `npm install` - install npm dependencies
- `npm start` - start the react project
- `npm run build` - bundle up this application
- `npm run deploy` - deployment command
- `npm run analyze` - run source map explorer 
- `npx cypress run` - cypress E2E tests in headless mode
- `npx cypress run --component` - cypress components tests in headless mode
- `npx cypress open` - open cypress GUI

## Continuous Integration

Check continuous integration configuration file: [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://github.com/Dovis01/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml).

### Pipeline

Four stages in pipeline: install, build, test, deploy.

### Branching policy

- Develop Branch - execute Install and build jobs only.
- Main Branch - perform Install, build, test and deploy jobs.

## Code Splitting.

+ src/index.js
+ src/pages/addMovieReviewPage.js
+ src/pages/movieDetailsPage.js

## Independent learning.

### Automated Component Tests

- Simulate API request data and provide sample api data to running component test
- Display basic elements and content in components
- Test whether the wanted buttons appear when the components are rendered
- Add environment configuration in [`cypress.config.js`](https://github.com/Dovis01/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie/blob/main/cypress.config.js)
- Add configuration of automated components test in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://github.com/Dovis01/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml)
- `cypress/component/UpcomingPage.cy.js`
- `cypress/component/WeekTrendPage.cy.js`

```javascript
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000/",
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx}',
    viewportWidth: 1980,
    viewportHeight: 1080,
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
    },
  },

  component: {
    specPattern: 'cypress/component/**/*.cy.{js,jsx}',
    devServer: {
      framework: "create-react-app",
      bundler: "webpack",
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
e2e_test:
  stage: test
  image: cypress/browsers:node16.13.0-chrome95-ff94
  only:
    - main
  script:
    - echo "Run e2e tests in headless mode"
    - npx serve -s ./build  -l 3000  &
    - npx cypress run --e2e --browser chrome

component_test:
  stage: test
  image: cypress/browsers:node16.13.0-chrome95-ff94
  only:
    - main
  script:
    - echo "Run cypress component tests in headless mode"
    - npx cypress run --component
```

```jsx
cy.mount(
            <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
                <Router>
                    <MoviesContextProvider>
                        <UpcomingMoviesPage/>
                    </MoviesContextProvider>
                </Router>
                <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false}/>
            </QueryClientProvider>
        );
cy.mount(
            <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
                <Router>
                    <MoviesContextProvider>
                        <WeekTrendingMoviesPage/>
                    </MoviesContextProvider>
                </Router>
                <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false}/>
            </QueryClientProvider>
        );
```

### Auto Deployment

Use `GitHub Pages` to implement the simple auto deployment, and it will delivery every time if there is an update in `main` branch in gitlab.

Add configuration of auto deployment in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://github.com/Dovis01/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml) and [`package.json`](https://github.com/Dovis01/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie/blob/main/package.json)

This is the auto deployment pipeline stage code in `.gitlab.ci.yml`:

```yaml
auto_deploy:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - main
  script:
    - npm install -g gh-pages
    - echo "Deploying to GitHub Pages"
    - git config --global user.email "20104636@mail.wit.ie"
    - git config --global user.name "Shijin Zhang"
    - gh-pages -d build -r https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/Dovis01/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie.git
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://dovis01.github.io/Agile-Assignment1-ReactMovie
```

This is the screenshot for CICD pipeline auto_deploy job passing:

![](src/images/docs/deployPass.jpg)

This is the changed part of `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    ...other part...
  },
...other part...
"homepage": "https://dovis01.github.io"
```
